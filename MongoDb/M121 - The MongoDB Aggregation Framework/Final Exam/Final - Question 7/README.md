# Problem
Using the air_alliances and air_routes collections, find which alliance has the most unique carriers(airlines) operating between the airports JFK and LHR.

Names are distinct, i.e. Delta != Delta Air Lines

src_airport and dst_airport contain the originating and terminating airport information.

Choose the best answer:
 - OneWorld, with 4 carriers
 - SkyTeam, with 4 carriers
 - Star Alliance, with 6 carriers
 - OneWorld, with 8 carriers
