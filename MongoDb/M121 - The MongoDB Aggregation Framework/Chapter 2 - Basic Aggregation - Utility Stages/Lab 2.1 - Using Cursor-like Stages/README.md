# Problem
MongoDB has another movie night scheduled. This time, we polled employees for their favorite actress or actor, and got these results

    favorites = [
      "Sandra Bullock",
      "Tom Hanks",
      "Julia Roberts",
      "Kevin Spacey",
      "George Clooney"]

For movies released in the USA with a tomatoes.viewer.rating greater than or equal to 3, calculate a new field called num_favs that represets how many favorites appear in the cast field of the movie.

Sort your results by num_favs, tomatoes.viewer.rating, and title, all in descending order.

What is the title of the 25th film in the aggregation result?

Choose the best answer:
 - Wrestling Ernest Hemingway
 - Recount
 - Erin Brockovich
 - The Heat
